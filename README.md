## CodeMirror Integration

CodeMirror is used to provide a powerful and flexible code editing experience within the LetsCode application. It supports various programming languages and features such as:

- **Syntax Highlighting**: Color-codes different parts of the code to improve readability.
- **Code Autocompletion**: Suggests possible completions as you type, reducing errors and speeding up coding.
- **Code Folding**: Allows users to collapse and expand sections of code for easier navigation.

## Usage

- **Code Editing**: Use CodeMirror to write and edit code in the browser.
- **Code Compilation and Execution**: Submit code to be compiled and executed by the backend engine. Results and errors are displayed directly on the interface.
